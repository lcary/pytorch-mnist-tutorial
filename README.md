PyTorch MNIST Tutorial
======================

This repo contains a convolutional neural network that can be trained to 
extract features from MNIST data and recognize images. All code is based
on the following tutorial:

### Usage

To download MNIST data and train the neural network:

```bash
python run_neural_net.py
```

To graph the data:
```bash
python graph.py
```


Example output:
